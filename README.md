# MusicSender
A web app with which you can send music to friends via phone

You can set up a Twilio account, buy a phone number and enter your credentials.

Deploy this app on a server and your number is ready to receive requests.
Messaging syntax: [Song name], [Phone Number to Send]

(Sound quality of songs sent still needs to be improved)
